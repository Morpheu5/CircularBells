CircularBells is currently unlicensed. This means you are free to have a look at the source code and use it strictly privately and in a non-commercial capacity.

However, you are not free to redistribute it, neither for free nor for a fee, neither in source code form nor in binary form. This limitation applies to the entirety of the source code, and parts of it, unless explicitly stated.

Bummer, I know. I'd like to release this with a OSI compatible license, but I have yet to figure out one that both protects my work and plays nicely with the various distribution channels (aka, the app stores). If you have any suggestions, please get in touch.

This license is liable to change in the future.
